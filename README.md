# 🎯 Number Guessing Game

A terminal-based guessing challenge where **either you guess the computer’s number**, *or* the **computer reads your mind** (sort of). No GUI. No fluff. Just raw Python logic and terminal-core vibes.

## 🤔 Why I Built This
This project is my tribute to old-school math class number games — but turbocharged with Python. It’s simple, fun, and shows how basic logic structures like loops and conditions can create an interactive, intelligent game.
